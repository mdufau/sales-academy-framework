# 1️⃣ Competency Framework

> The competency framework is the foundation of any Sales Academy. Without it, you're building on sand.

## What is a sales competency framework?

A competency framework defines **what "good" looks like** for each sales role, at each level of seniority. It answers the question:

> *"What does a high-performing [Sales Rep / Account Manager / Sales Manager] at [level X] know, do, and demonstrate?"*

It serves as the backbone for:
- Training and certification paths
- Onboarding programs
- Performance reviews and development plans
- Recruitment criteria
- Coaching conversations

## Step 1 — Define your sales roles

Start by mapping all commercial roles in scope.

| Role | Level | Channel | Key mission |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sales Rep | Junior | B2C | Acquisition |
| Sales Rep | Senior | B2C | Acquisition + Upsell |
| Account Manager | Mid | B2B | Retention + Upsell |
| Sales Manager | Lead | All | Team performance |

> 💡 **Tip:** Resist the urge to create too many roles. Start with 3–5 core profiles and refine over time.

---

## Step 2 — Define your competency domains

Group competencies into 4–6 domains. A typical Sales Academy framework covers:

### Domain 1 — Product & Market Knowledge
- Product features, benefits, and positioning
- Competitive landscape
- Customer segments and use cases
- Pricing and offers

### Domain 2 — Sales Skills & Methodology
- Prospecting and pipeline management
- Discovery and needs analysis
- Pitch and value proposition
- Objection handling
- Closing and negotiation
- Upsell and retention techniques

### Domain 3 — Customer Experience & Relationship
- Customer-centric mindset
- Active listening
- Complaint handling
- Building long-term relationships
- Brand standards and premium experience

### Domain 4 — Tools & Processes
- CRM usage and discipline
- Sales reporting and pipeline hygiene
- Internal processes and compliance
- Digital tools and platforms

### Domain 5 — Professional Effectiveness
- Time management and prioritization
- Resilience and dealing with rejection
- Collaboration with internal teams
- Continuous learning mindset

### Domain 6 — Management & Leadership *(for sales managers)*
- Team coaching and performance conversations
- Setting goals and tracking KPIs
- Onboarding and developing team members
- Change management

## Step 3 — Define proficiency levels

For each competency, define what it looks like at each level. A simple 3-level scale works well:

| Level | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Developing** | Understands the concept, needs support to apply it |
| 2 | **Proficient** | Applies independently in standard situations |
| 3 | **Expert** | Applies in complex situations, can coach others |

---

## Step 4 — Build the competency matrix

Map each role × each competency × expected proficiency level.

**Example extract:**

| Competency | Junior Rep | Senior Rep | Account Manager | Sales Manager |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product knowledge | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2 |
| Discovery & needs analysis | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| Objection handling | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| CRM discipline | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| Team coaching | — | — | 1 | 3 |

> 💡 **Tip:** Validate this matrix with Sales Leadership and HR before publishing. Buy-in at the top is essential for adoption.

---

## Step 5 — Validate and govern

A competency framework only works if it's owned by the business — not just L&D.

**Recommended validation process:**

1. Draft with L&D team based on top performer analysis and manager interviews
2. Review with Sales Leadership (VP Sales, Sales Directors)
3. Align with HR (integration into performance reviews)
4. Validate at Executive Committee level if possible
5. Communicate to all managers before rolling out to teams
6. Review and update annually

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Building in a silo** — L&D alone cannot define what "good" looks like in sales. Sales leaders must co-own the framework.

❌ **Too many competencies** — A framework with 40 competencies will never be used. Aim for 15–25 maximum.

❌ **Ignoring existing knowledge** — Top performers already exist in the team. Interview them. They are your best source of truth.

❌ **One-size-fits-all** — A Junior B2C rep and a Senior B2B Account Manager have very different needs. Differentiate.

❌ **Set and forget** — Products, markets, and strategies evolve. Review the framework at least once a year.
