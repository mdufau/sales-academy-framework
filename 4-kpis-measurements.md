# 4️⃣ KPIs & Measurement

> If you can't measure it, you can't improve it — and you can't defend it to the business.

## Why measurement matters

L&D teams that can't demonstrate impact are always at risk of being cut. Those that speak the language of business — revenue, ramp-up time, retention, conversion rates — earn a seat at the table.

A Sales Academy measurement framework serves three purposes:

1. **Prove value** — show the business that the Academy delivers ROI
2. **Drive improvement** — identify what's working and what isn't
3. **Sustain investment** — give leadership the data they need to keep funding it

## The Kirkpatrick model — adapted for Sales Academies

The Kirkpatrick model provides a 4-level framework for evaluating training impact:

| Level | What you measure | The question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Reaction** | Learner satisfaction and perceived relevance | *Did learners find it useful?* |
| **L2 — Learning** | Knowledge and skill acquisition | *Did they actually learn?* |
| **L3 — Behavior** | On-the-job application | *Are they doing things differently?* |
| **L4 — Results** | Business impact | *Did it move the needle?* |

Most L&D teams measure L1 and L2 well. The real value — and the real challenge — is in L3 and L4.

---

## Level 1 — Reaction KPIs

**When:** Immediately after each training session or module completion.

| KPI | How to measure |
|---|---|
| Satisfaction score (NPS or 1–5 scale) | Post-session survey |
| Perceived relevance | *"How relevant was this to your daily work?"* (1–5) |
| Perceived quality | *"How would you rate the quality of this training?"* (1–5) |
| Net Promoter Score | *"Would you recommend this training to a colleague?"* (0–10) |

> 💡 **Target:** Aim for a satisfaction score above 4/5 and NPS above +30.

---

## Level 2 — Learning KPIs

**When:** During and at the end of each module or program.

| KPI | How to measure |
|---|---|
| Assessment pass rate | % of learners passing knowledge checks above threshold |
| Average assessment score | Mean score across all learners |
| Completion rate | % of enrolled learners completing the module |
| Certification rate | % achieving certification at each milestone |
| Pre/post knowledge gain | Score comparison before and after training |

> 💡 **Target:** Completion rate above 80%, pass rate above 75% on first attempt.

---

## Level 3 — Behavior KPIs

**When:** 30, 60, and 90 days after training completion.

| KPI | How to measure |
|---|---|
| Manager observation score | Structured observation grid completed by direct manager |
| Self-assessed skill confidence | *"How confident are you applying [skill X] today?"* (1–5) |
| Behavioral change survey | Manager and learner survey 60 days post-training |
| Coaching conversation quality | Frequency and quality of 1:1s (tracked by managers) |
| CRM discipline | % of reps with up-to-date pipeline (proxy for process adoption) |

> 💡 **Tip:** Design the observation grid together with Sales Leadership so they see it as a tool, not a burden.

---

## Level 4 — Results KPIs

**When:** 3 to 6 months after program completion.

These are the KPIs that matter most to the business. Connect them directly to your training cohorts.

| Business outcome | KPI | Comparison |
|---|---|---|
| Ramp-up acceleration | Time to first deal (new hires) | Academy cohort vs. pre-Academy baseline |
| Revenue performance | Revenue per rep | Certified vs. non-certified reps |
| Retention | 12-month attrition rate | Academy participants vs. non-participants |
| Conversion | Lead-to-deal conversion rate | Before vs. after sales methodology training |
| Upsell performance | Upsell rate per rep | Pre/post upsell training |
| Onboarding efficiency | Time to autonomy | 30/60/90 day performance milestones |

> 💡 **Tip:** Always establish a baseline *before* the training. Without a baseline, you can't prove impact.

---

## LMS / LXP engagement KPIs

If you run a learning platform, track platform health as a leading indicator:

| KPI | Description |
|---|---|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | % of enrolled learners active in the past 30 days |
| Content consumption rate | Average number of modules completed per learner per month |
| Voluntary learning rate | % of learning initiated by the learner (not assigned) |
| Community engagement | Posts, reactions, comments per week |
| Mobile usage rate | % of content consumed on mobile |

> 💡 **A platform with low voluntary learning rate is a platform people use because they have to, not because they want to.** That's a signal to review content relevance and quality.

## Building your measurement dashboard

### Recommended reporting cadence

| Audience | Frequency | Content |
|---|---|---|
| L&D team | Weekly | Completion rates, platform engagement, upcoming sessions |
| Sales managers | Monthly | Team completion, certification status, behavioral KPIs |
| Sales leadership | Quarterly | Business impact KPIs, Academy ROI, strategic highlights |
| Executive / COMEX | Bi-annual | Strategic impact, investment vs. return, roadmap |

### Sample quarterly dashboard structure

```

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Measuring only what's easy** — completion rates are easy. Business impact is hard. Do the hard work.

❌ **No baseline** — if you don't know where you started, you can't prove where you've arrived.

❌ **Reporting to L&D only** — measurement only creates value when it's shared with and acted on by the business.

❌ **Confusing correlation and causation** — improved sales results after training may have other causes. Be honest about what you can and cannot attribute to learning.

❌ **Measuring everything** — pick 5–8 KPIs that matter and track them consistently. A 40-metric dashboard is ignored.
