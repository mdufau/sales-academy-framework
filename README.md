# 🎤 Practical Facilitation Guide

> Facilitation is the art of creating the conditions for learning. Your job is not to be the expert in the room — it's to help the room learn together.

## The facilitator's core principles

1. **Ask, don't tell** — questions open minds; statements close them
2. **Make it safe** — psychological safety is the prerequisite for learning
3. **Honor the experience in the room** — your participants know things you don't
4. **Stay curious** — the moment you think you know how the session will go, you stop facilitating
5. **Serve the objectives** — everything you do should connect back to the learning goals

## Opening a session

### The first 10 minutes matter most

The opening sets the tone for everything that follows. Use it to:

- **Welcome** participants warmly and personally
- **Frame** the session — why this, why now, why them
- **Clarify** the agenda, timing, and ground rules
- **Connect** participants to each other (icebreaker if needed)
- **Activate** prior knowledge — what do they already know?

### Sample opening structure *(30-person group, 1-day session)*

| Time | Activity |
|---|---|
| 0–5 min | Welcome, housekeeping |
| 5–15 min | Icebreaker / introductions |
| 15–20 min | Frame the day: objectives, agenda, "what's in it for you" |
| 20–25 min | Ground rules (co-created with the group) |
| 25–30 min | Activation question: "What do you already know about X?" |

## Asking great questions

Questions are your primary facilitation tool. Master these types:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Open** | Explore thinking | *"What's your experience with...?"* |
| **Probing** | Go deeper | *"Can you say more about that?"* |
| **Redirecting** | Involve others | *"What do others think?"* |
| **Challenging** | Stretch thinking | *"What if the opposite were true?"* |
| **Summarizing** | Consolidate | *"So what I'm hearing is... Is that right?"* |
| **Connecting** | Link ideas | *"How does that relate to what Marie said earlier?"* |

### Questions to avoid
- **Leading questions:** *"Don't you think that...?"* — you're not asking, you're telling
- **Double questions:** *"What did you think, and how did it make you feel?"* — pick one
- **Yes/no questions:** they shut down conversation

## Managing group dynamics

### The silent participant
- Don't force them — some people think before they speak
- Try small group discussion first, then invite sharing
- Use written activities (post-its, polls) to give everyone a voice

### The dominant participant
- Validate their contribution, then open to others: *"Great point — who else has a perspective?"*
- Use round-robins to ensure everyone speaks
- Speak to them privately during a break if needed

### The resistant participant
- Stay curious, not defensive: *"That's interesting — tell me more"*
- Acknowledge their experience: *"It sounds like you've tried something similar before"*
- Don't fight resistance — work with it

### The off-topic tangent
- *"That's a really interesting point — let's note it in our 'parking lot' and come back to it"*
- Use a visible parking lot (flip chart or virtual board) to capture ideas for later

---

## Running activities & discussions

### Small group work
- Give crystal-clear instructions before forming groups
- Assign roles (timekeeper, note-taker, spokesperson)
- Set a visible timer
- Debrief in plenary: what did you discuss? What did you decide? What surprised you?

### Plenary discussions
- Stand up and move around the room (for in-person) — it changes the energy
- Use a T-chart or whiteboard to capture key ideas visibly
- Summarize regularly: *"So far we've said X, Y, Z — what's missing?"*

### Role plays & simulations
- Always brief before, debrief after
- Give clear roles and scenarios in writing
- Debrief with the observer first, then the participant
- Focus on behavior, not personality: *"What did you notice?"* not *"How did they do?"*

## Closing a session

### The last 15 minutes are as important as the first

A strong close helps learners consolidate, commit, and leave energized.

| Element | Purpose | Example activity |
|---|---|---|
| **Summary** | Consolidate learning | "3 things I'm taking away" — round robin |
| **Connection** | Link to real life | "How will you apply this next week?" |
| **Commitment** | Drive action | Individual action plan (1 action, 1 date) |
| **Evaluation** | Gather feedback | Quick satisfaction survey |
| **Closing** | End on a high | Thank the group, celebrate what was achieved |

## Virtual facilitation: specific tips

Virtual sessions require extra intentionality — the screen creates distance.

- **Shorter blocks** — max 45–50 minutes of content, then a break or activity
- **Camera on** — model it yourself and gently encourage it
- **Check-ins more often** — *"Thumbs up if you can follow?"* or quick polls
- **Vary the format** — alternate between presenting, discussing, activities
- **Use the chat actively** — pose questions, invite responses in writing
- **Breakout rooms** — even 8 minutes in small groups changes the energy
- **Name people** — *"I'd love to hear from Julien on this"* — prevents anonymity

## Self-assessment after each session

Rate yourself 1–5 on each:

- [ ] I created a safe and engaging learning environment
- [ ] I stuck to the objectives without being rigid
- [ ] I asked more than I told
- [ ] I managed time effectively
- [ ] I read the room and adapted when needed
- [ ] I gave all participants a voice
- [ ] I ended with clear takeaways and commitments
