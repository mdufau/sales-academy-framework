# 🏆 Sales Academy Framework

A practical, field-tested framework for designing and deploying a Sales Academy — from competency mapping to long-term learning architecture.

This framework is based on real-world experience building Sales Academies at scale, covering hundreds of sales professionals across B2B and B2C environments.

> **Anonymized and generalized for open-source use.** Adapt it to your organization's context, culture, and commercial strategy.

## Why a Sales Academy?

A Sales Academy is not a training catalog. It's a **strategic, structured, long-term approach** to developing commercial talent — aligned with business priorities and embedded in the day-to-day rhythm of the sales organization.

Done well, a Sales Academy:

- Accelerates ramp-up for new hires
- Harmonizes sales practices across teams and channels
- Creates a common language and culture of excellence
- Connects learning to measurable business outcomes
- Supports talent retention and career development

## Key design principles

**1. Business-first**
Every element of the Academy must connect to a commercial priority. Training for training's sake is waste.

**2. Competency-based**
Build on a clear, shared definition of what "good" looks like at each role and level.

**3. Blended by design**
Combine formal learning, on-the-job practice, and peer learning — following the 70/20/10 model.

**4. Always-on**
A Sales Academy is not an event. It's an ecosystem learners return to continuously.

**5. Governed and measured**
Cross-functional governance (Sales, HR, Operations) and regular KPI reviews are non-negotiable.
