# 2️⃣ Learning Architecture

> Once you know *what* to develop (competency framework), you need to design *how* to develop it. That's your learning architecture.

## What is a learning architecture?

A learning architecture is the **overall structure of how learning is organized, sequenced, and delivered** across the Sales Academy. It answers:

- What learning formats will we use?
- How are they sequenced over time?
- How do they connect to each other?
- How do we balance formal, social, and on-the-job learning?

## The 70/20/10 model as a design principle

The most effective learning architectures don't rely on classroom or e-learning alone. They distribute learning across three modes:

| Mode | % | What it looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **On-the-job learning** | 70% | Real calls, deals, customer interactions, stretch assignments |
| **Social learning** | 20% | Coaching, peer learning, communities of practice, shadowing |
| **Formal learning** | 10% | E-learning, classroom, virtual sessions, certifications |

> 💡 **Implication for design:** For every 1 hour of e-learning you create, ask yourself: *"What are the 9 hours of practice and social learning that will make this stick?"*

## Core components of a Sales Academy architecture

### 1. Onboarding path
*For new hires — from Day 1 to full performance*

A structured journey that combines product knowledge, sales methodology, tools training, and cultural immersion. Typically spans 30 to 90 days.

→ See [`3-onboarding-integration.md`](./3-onboarding-integration.md) for full detail.

### 2. Core curriculum
*For all sales roles — the non-negotiable foundation*

A set of essential modules every salesperson must complete, regardless of role or seniority. Typically includes:
- Sales methodology and process
- Product fundamentals
- Customer experience standards
- CRM and tools basics

### 3. Role-specific paths
*Differentiated by role and level*

Modules and programs targeting the specific competency gaps of each profile. A Junior B2C rep has different learning needs than a Senior B2B Account Manager.

### 4. Certification program
*Validating competency at key milestones*

Formal assessments that validate a learner has reached the expected proficiency level. Can be:
- Knowledge-based (quiz, written assessment)
- Skills-based (role play, observed call, manager validation)
- Combined

### 5. Continuous learning layer
*Always-on, pull-based content*

Short, targeted content learners can access anytime: product updates, sales tips, competitive intel, best practice videos. Often delivered via LMS/LXP or mobile app.

### 6. Community & social learning
*Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing*

Best practice communities, internal champions, mentoring programs, team debriefs. Often underinvested — and among the highest-impact levers.

## Designing the learning path: a practical approach

### Step 1 — Map the learner journey

For each role, map the journey from Day 1 to full performance:

```
Day 1 ──── Week 1 ──── Month 1 ──── Month 3 ──── Month 6 ──── Year 1+
  │            │           │            │             │            │
Welcome    Foundations  Core skills  Certification  Advanced    Community
& culture  & onboarding & practice   checkpoint     paths       & mastery
```

### Step 2 — Choose the right format for each objective

| Learning objective | Recommended format |
|---|---|
| Know a product feature | E-learning module / video |
| Understand a sales process | Blended: e-learning + classroom practice |
| Apply an objection-handling technique | Role play + coaching debrief |
| Develop strategic account management | Long-term coaching + on-the-job project |
| Stay updated on product news | Mobile push / microlearning |
| Share best practices | Community platform / peer sessions |

### Step 3 — Sequence and pace

Avoid overloading learners. A practical rule:
- **New hires:** max 2–3 hours of formal learning per day during onboarding
- **Tenured reps:** max 4–5 days of formal training per year, spread throughout
- **Managers:** dedicated sessions separate from their teams

### Step 4 — Choose your platforms

| Need | Platform type |
|---|---|
| Host and track e-learning | LMS (360Learning, Cornerstone, EdCast...) |
| Collaborative learning & social features | LXP |
| Mobile content for field teams | Mobile app (custom or LMS mobile) |
| Live virtual sessions | Zoom, Teams, Webex |
| Authoring e-learning content | Genially, Vyond, Articulate, Rise |

## Multi-year Academy roadmap

A Sales Academy is built over time. Here's a typical 3-year vision:

| Year | Focus | Key deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **Year 1** | Foundation | Competency framework, onboarding path, core e-learning modules, LMS launch |
| **Year 2** | Depth | Role-specific paths, certification program, coaching integration, community launch |
| **Year 3** | Excellence | Advanced programs, manager academy, measurement maturity, content refresh cycle |

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Starting with content before architecture** — don't produce a single module before the overall structure is validated.

❌ **Ignoring the 70 and 20** — if your Academy is 100% e-learning, it's not an Academy. It's a content library.

❌ **Building for the average learner** — differentiate by role, level, and channel from the start.

❌ **No refresh cycle** — content becomes outdated fast in sales environments. Plan for regular updates from day one.

❌ **LMS as a dumping ground** — a platform full of uncurated content destroys engagement. Curate ruthlessly.
