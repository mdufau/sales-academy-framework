# 3️⃣ Onboarding Integration

> The fastest way to accelerate ramp-up is to make the Sales Academy the spine of your onboarding — not an add-on.

---

## Why onboarding is your highest-leverage moment

New hires are:
- **Motivated** — they want to prove themselves
- **Available** — they haven't yet been pulled into day-to-day demands
- **Impressionable** — their first 90 days shape their habits, beliefs, and culture for years

A structured, Academy-integrated onboarding can reduce time-to-first-deal by 20–40% and significantly improve 12-month retention.

## The 3 dimensions of sales onboarding

Effective sales onboarding addresses three dimensions simultaneously:

| Dimension | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Cultural** | Who we are, what we stand for, how we work |
| **Commercial** | Our products, our customers, our sales process |
| **Operational** | Our tools, our processes, our reporting |

Most onboarding programs over-invest in operational content and under-invest in culture and commercial fundamentals.

## The 30 / 60 / 90 day framework

### 🗓️ Days 1–30 — Discover & absorb

**Goal:** New hire understands the company, the product, the customer, and the sales process.

| Week | Focus | Key activities |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Welcome & culture | Team introductions, company overview, values, tools setup |
| Week 2 | Product & market | Product deep-dive, competitive landscape, customer segments |
| Week 3 | Sales methodology | Sales process, key techniques, CRM training |
| Week 4 | Observation | Shadow top performers, listen to recorded calls, debrief with manager |

**Formal learning:** 2–3 hours/day maximum  
**Assessment checkpoint:** Knowledge quiz at end of Month 1

---

### 🗓️ Days 31–60 — Practice & apply

**Goal:** New hire starts applying in real situations, with support.

| Activity | Description |
|---|---|
| First calls / first deals | Supervised, with structured debrief afterward |
| Coaching sessions | Weekly 1:1 with manager focused on skills, not just pipeline |
| Peer learning | Buddy system with a senior rep |
| Role plays | Practiced in a safe environment before going live |
| LMS completion | Core curriculum modules, at own pace |

**Assessment checkpoint:** Skills observation by manager at end of Month 2

---

### 🗓️ Days 61–90 — Perform & certify

**Goal:** New hire reaches baseline autonomy and completes first certification.

| Activity | Description |
|---|---|
| Independent performance | Managing own pipeline with decreasing supervision |
| First certification | Knowledge + skills assessment validating Month 1–3 learning |
| Development plan | Manager and new hire co-create a 6-month development plan |
| Academy integration | New hire is now fully enrolled in the ongoing Academy path |

**Assessment checkpoint:** Certification + manager validation at Day 90

---

## Roles and responsibilities

| Who | Responsibilities during onboarding |
|---|---|
| **L&D / Academy team** | Design and maintain the onboarding path, e-learning content, and assessments |
| **Direct manager** | Weekly coaching, skills observation, day-90 validation |
| **HR** | Administrative onboarding, culture integration, 30/60/90 check-ins |
| **Buddy / mentor** | Day-to-day support, informal knowledge sharing |
| **Sales leadership** | Welcome session, vision and strategy, signal that learning matters |

---

## Integration with the broader Academy

The onboarding path should feed directly into the ongoing Academy:

```
Onboarding path (Day 1 → Day 90)
        │
        ▼
Core curriculum (shared by all sales roles)
        │
        ▼
Role-specific path (based on role + competency gaps)
        │
        ▼
Certification program (milestone validation)
        │
        ▼
Continuous learning (always-on content + community)
```

A new hire who completes onboarding should know exactly what their next learning steps are — not feel like they've graduated and "done" training.

## Key success factors

✅ **Manager buy-in is non-negotiable** — if managers don't believe in the onboarding, new hires won't either. Brief them. Train them. Give them the tools.

✅ **Keep formal learning to a minimum** — new hires are overwhelmed. Prioritize what's essential to perform, and deliver the rest over time.

✅ **Make it social from day one** — the buddy system, team lunches, and informal conversations are as important as e-learning modules.

✅ **Celebrate milestones** — completing the Month 1 certification or first deal should be recognized publicly.

✅ **Gather feedback and iterate** — survey new hires at Day 30, 60, and 90. The onboarding program should improve with every cohort.

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Death by PowerPoint in Week 1** — 5 days of product presentations destroys motivation. Mix formats, involve people, make it interactive.

❌ **No manager involvement** — an onboarding left entirely to L&D is an onboarding without accountability.

❌ **Too much too soon** — prioritize. A new hire cannot absorb 200 product SKUs in Week 2.

❌ **No structured debrief after first calls** — observation without reflection is just experience, not learning.

❌ **Disconnected from the Academy** — if onboarding ends at Day 90 and there's no "what's next", the learning momentum is lost.
